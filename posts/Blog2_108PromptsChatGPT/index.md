### Trend xuyên không

<i>A highly detailed 3D diorama-style digital illustration inspired by the historic Battle of Điện Biên Phủ (1954). The scene depicts an intense battlefield in a mountainous valley surrounded by dense jungles and muddy trenches, filled with chibi-style soldiers representing the Vietnamese resistance forces and French colonial troops.
In the center, chibi Vietnamese soldiers in green uniforms and pith helmets rush forward with determined expressions, some carrying rifles, others hauling artillery shells or waving flags. Explosions erupt from enemy positions. Smoke fills the jungle-covered hills. Chibi French forces fire from bunkers, tanks push forward over wooden bridges, and aircraft drop flares above the battlefield.
Artillery cannons fire in the background, and communication lines stretch between trenches. Every character is fully engaged — shouting orders, running through mud, launching counterattacks — completely immersed in the heat of the historic battle.
But near the back of the scene, nestled under a camouflaged tarp behind a stack of supply crates, a miniature-sized modern-day chibi programmer calmly sits at a tiny folding desk.
Wearing glasses and a navy-blue “AWL” T-shirt, he types steadily on a glowing blue laptop. Code scrolls silently across the screen.
No soldier, no officer, no fighter notices him — he’s entirely disconnected from the world, like a small ghost in the system or a peaceful easter egg in a storm of history.
A small golden plaque on his desk reads:
"Alex V – đang fix bug"
Style:
3D chibi characters, Pixar-meets-historical-war style, cinematic battlefield lighting with explosions and dusk haze, muddy trench textures, dramatic motion, large-vs-tiny contrast, hidden humorous detail of a completely ignored programmer in a legendary war.</i>

### Dạy nấu ăn

<i>A clean and minimalistic top-down food infographic for "Pizza Hải Sản" with all text in Vietnamese. The layout displays all the ingredients neatly arranged with clear Vietnamese labels. Ingredients include: bột bánh pizza, sốt cà chua, phô mai mozzarella bào sợi, tôm, mực cắt khoanh, vẹm, tỏi, dầu ô liu, và ngò tây cắt nhỏ. Each ingredient is shown raw and placed in small bowls or directly on a light, clean background. Below the ingredients, simple black line icons with Vietnamese labels illustrate the cooking steps: phết sốt cà chua lên đế bánh, thêm nhân, và nướng bánh. At the bottom, a perfectly baked seafood pizza is shown from above with golden crust, melted cheese, and beautifully arranged seafood toppings, garnished with parsley. The bold, centered title reads “PIZZA HẢI SẢN”. The overall style is minimalistic, modern, clean, and visually informative—suitable for a recipe card, cookbook, or Vietnamese cooking blog.

### Diorama nghề nghiệp
<i>A highly detailed miniature diorama of an AI engineer named Alex V, standing in a modern AI research lab. The nameplate at the front reads 'Alex V – AI Engineer'. The scene features a sleek workstation with multiple monitors displaying AI code, a robotic assistant, and server racks glowing with blue LED lights. The background includes a whiteboard with deep learning diagrams, potted plants, and a bookshelf filled with tech books. The lighting is a mix of warm ambient and cool blue from the screens, creating a futuristic and professional atmosphere.</i>

### Trend 30/4
<i>Create a highly detailed and imaginative miniature diorama in a dollhouse style, inspired by the Vietnamese Liberation Day (April 30th, 1975). The scene should depict a Vietnamese tank (a T-55 model, with its iconic round turret and distinctive tracks) in the foreground, with three smiling soldiers riding it, holding the Vietnamese flag featuring a large yellow star. The tank is proudly rolling through the wreckage of a gate, symbolizing the fall of Saigon, and the flag waves proudly in the wind. In the background, include a building with post-1975 Vietnamese architectural style, featuring neutral beige tones, simple windows, and a modest design that reflects the era. Add clouds in the sky and trees on either side of the scene, balancing the military focus with natural elements. On the ground, scatter broken gates and debris, signifying the destruction during the battle. At the bottom of the diorama, include an engraved wooden plaque with the date “30/04/1975”. The entire diorama should be crafted in a handmade miniature style, using earthy tones such as muted greens, browns, and grays, with textures like wood, ceramic, and clay to give it an organic, handcrafted appearance. Use warm lighting to highlight the celebratory nature of the historical moment, with a vintage feel to the overall atmosphere.</i>

### Trend mô hình cặp đôi
<i>Create a highly detailed 3D miniature diorama in a chibi-style romantic theme. The scene should feature two figures, Linh (on the left) and Vượng (on the right), standing together in a red velvet jewelry box with the words "LOVE STORY" at the top, and a sparkling background of stars and soft glowing lights. Linh (the woman) should be depicted wearing a cream-colored trench coat over a black turtleneck and a white pleated skirt. Her hair should be styled in soft waves, and she should have a gentle, warm smile. Her features are in a chibi-style with a large head and small body. Vượng (the man) should be depicted wearing a light tan sweatshirt and blue jeans, with glasses and a friendly smile. His features should also be in chibi-style with a large head and small body, and he should have one hand resting confidently on his waist. The red velvet jewelry box serves as the backdrop for the couple, with a golden engraved nameplate at the front that reads "LINH & VƯỢNG". The background inside the box should contain a soft-focus effect with glowing stars, adding to the romantic and magical feeling of the scene. The entire diorama should have a handcrafted appearance, with smooth textures, vibrant colors, and a highly stylized cartoon look, emphasizing a cute, cheerful, and loving atmosphere.</i>

### Trend nghề nghiệp và mệnh
<i>Create a highly detailed 3D diorama-style digital illustration featuring a chibi-style character resembling Alex V, an AI Engineer. The character should be depicted in a playful stance with a large head, small body, and oversized glasses, wearing a navy blue "AWL" t-shirt. The character should be surrounded by floating objects related to AI and technology, such as laptops, code snippets, and a floating soccer ball, which represents his interest in programming and sports. The background should have an earthy theme, with soil, rocks, and sand elements gently floating around the character, reflecting Alex's Earth (Thổ) element. The floating earth particles should be illuminated by soft, ambient lighting, creating a surreal yet grounded atmosphere. The overall tone of the scene should be warm, stable, and playful, capturing Alex's creative and professional essence. The lighting should highlight the floating objects and the character, creating a contrast between the earthy theme and the tech-inspired elements around him. The diorama should feel harmonious, combining Earth elements with the high-tech world of AI programming.</i>

### Trend tượng thạch cao
<i>Create a marble bust statue in a neoclassical style of a young man. The statue should have a realistic and smooth finish, with detailed facial features, soft lighting, and a clean background. The character should have a natural and serene expression, and the bust should only focus on the face and upper shoulders, without any arms or extra details. The lighting should create soft shadows to enhance the realism of the marble texture.</i>

### Trend quê hương
<i>Create a highly detailed and imaginative miniature house model inspired by Vietnamese heritage, set in Bắc Ninh province. The scene includes the most iconic landmark of Bắc Ninh — the Đền Đô (Đô Temple) — meticulously recreated in miniature form with traditional roof tiles, wooden beams, and delicate red-brick pillars, surrounded by lush bonsai trees and a serene cultural courtyard. At the center stands AlexV, a chibi-style full-body character with a realistic, lifelike face and a humorous large head on a small body, smiling proudly. He is dressed in a traditional Quan họ Bắc Ninh costume, featuring a black áo tứ thân, khăn mỏ quạ (headscarf), and khăn đóng, representing the heritage of this northern province. AlexV is holding with both hands a giant, glossy, colorful "Bánh phu thê" (husband-and-wife cake) — a traditional sweet delicacy of Bắc Ninh — sprinkled with sesame and glistening under warm light. A small wooden sign beneath the cake reads: “Bánh phu thê – Bắc Ninh” in elegant Vietnamese calligraphy. The entire diorama is built as a miniature handmade model house, staged inside a shadowed box with a warm spotlight illuminating the character and main elements. The materials used — wood, silk textures, ceramic tiles, rustic paper lanterns — all reflect Bắc Ninh's traditional culture. At the base of the diorama is an engraved antique brass nameplate that reads: “AlexV – Bắc Ninh” In the bottom-right corner of the image, there is a very small artist signature line: “Alex V - AI Engineer” The entire image is styled in vibrant cartoon style, yet rich in cultural symbolism, combining a love for homeland with pride in local heritage and cuisine. Aspect ratio: Portrait 9:16</i>
